# Positioning Angles Library - Complete Reference

## Introduction

This library is a strategic reference for selecting, applying, and
testing positioning angles in advertising campaigns.

Positioning determines: - Who the product is for - Why it exists - How
it is different - What it rejects - What psychological triggers it
activates

Every downstream asset (copy, creative, offer structure, proof, tone)
must align with the selected positioning angle.

problem to create perceived expertise through constraint.

-   Reduced risk: "They work with people like me."
-   Scarcity through exclusion.

### When to Use

-   Crowded generalist market
-   Clear vertical niche exists
-   Demonstrable proof within niche

### When NOT to Use

-   Market too small to sustain growth
-   No credible experience in niche
-   Broad consumer product

### Best For

-   B2B SaaS
-   Agencies
-   Consulting
-   Legal and financial services
